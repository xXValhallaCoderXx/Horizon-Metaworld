# Configuration and Advanced Customization

## What & Why

This module covers advanced configuration options and customization techniques for modifying the sim tycoon reference world to create your own unique game experience in Horizon Worlds. It provides comprehensive guidance on game balance, performance optimization, monetization design, and extensibility patterns.

## Key APIs / Concepts

- **Economic Configuration**: Exchange rates, tool costs, progression scaling, currency caps
- **Balance Configuration**: Resource spawn rates, tool durability, mining efficiency, player limits
- **Performance Configuration**: Pool sizes, update frequencies, quality settings, mobile optimization
- **Resource Definition**: Visual appearance, rarity, tool compatibility, economic value
- **Tool Categories**: Utility tools, specialized tools, environment tools, automation tools
- **Virtual Economy**: Currency flow management, resource scarcity design, inflation prevention
- **Monetization Integration**: Premium content, value proposition design, fair play maintenance

## How-To (Recipe)

1. **Configure game economy**
   - Set exchange rates for resource to currency conversion
   - Define tool costs and progression scaling
   - Configure currency caps and limits
   - Balance reward values with game economy

2. **Create new resource types**
   - Define resource properties (appearance, rarity, compatibility)
   - Update core systems (spawning, inventory, HUD, save/load)
   - Integrate with economy (exchange rates, upgrade paths)
   - Balance rarity with reward value

3. **Implement new tool categories**
   - Design utility tools (scanners, processors, transport)
   - Create specialized tools (environment, economic, automation)
   - Define tool interactions and compatibility
   - Integrate with existing progression systems

4. **Optimize performance**
   - Configure object pool sizes for optimal performance
   - Set update frequencies and quality scaling
   - Implement mobile-specific optimizations
   - Handle multiplayer capacity planning

5. **Design monetization systems**
   - Create fair premium content (convenience vs power)
   - Maintain free player viability
   - Implement transparent pricing models
   - Design ongoing content updates

## Minimal Example

```typescript
// Game configuration system
interface GameConfig {
  economic: {
    exchangeRates: Record<string, number>;
    toolCosts: Record<string, number>;
    currencyCaps: Record<string, number>;
  };
  balance: {
    resourceSpawnRates: Record<string, number>;
    toolDurability: Record<string, number>;
    miningEfficiency: Record<string, number>;
  };
  performance: {
    poolSizes: Record<string, number>;
    updateFrequencies: Record<string, number>;
    qualitySettings: Record<string, any>;
  };
}

// Resource type definition
interface ResourceType {
  id: string;
  visual: {
    appearance: string;
    particles: string;
    color: string;
  };
  gameplay: {
    rarity: number;
    spawnFrequency: number;
    toolCompatibility: string[];
    economicValue: number;
  };
}

// Tool category system
abstract class Tool {
  abstract category: 'utility' | 'specialized' | 'environment';
  abstract useOn(target: ResourceNode): boolean;
  abstract getEfficiency(resourceType: string): number;
}
```

## Limits & Constraints

- **Performance Impact**: Configuration changes must maintain smooth gameplay performance
- **Mobile Optimization**: All customizations must work efficiently on mobile devices
- **Memory Management**: Resource limits for textures, audio, and game objects
- **Network Efficiency**: Multiplayer synchronization requirements and data limits
- **Balance Considerations**: Economic changes affect long-term player engagement
- **Platform Requirements**: iOS and Android have different optimization needs
- **Save Data Limits**: Player progress storage has size constraints

## Gotchas / Debugging

- **Economic Balance**: Inflation prevention requires careful source/sink management
- **Performance Scaling**: Quality settings must adapt to different device capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure consistency across different devices and platforms
- **Version Control**: Incremental changes are safer than large system overhauls
- **Player Feedback**: Analytics integration essential for understanding actual usage patterns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when systems fail or data is corrupted
- **Monetization Balance**: Premium options must enhance, not break, core gameplay
- **Configuration Dependencies**: Changes to one system may require updates to related systems
